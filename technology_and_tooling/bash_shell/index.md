Before we venture into Python, we need to take a look at the *Bash shell*, which is one way of running programs on a computer. Throughout this course we'll be using the Bash shell a great deal, and it's arguably an invaluable tool for anyone looking to write software: it can give you greater control over your computer's functions and in many circumstances operations are more efficient using a shell-type interface - particularly for repeating sequences of actions multiple times.
