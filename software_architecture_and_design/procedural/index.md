## The Procedural Paradigm

Procedural Programming is based around the idea that code should be structured into a set of **procedures**.
Each procedure (optionally) takes some input, performs some computation and (optionally) returns some output.
We can then use these procedures to perform computation, without having to be concerned with exactly how the computation is performed.

You may wish to think of the Procedural Paradigm as focussing on the **verbs** of a computation.
