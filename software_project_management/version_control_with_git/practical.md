###   Signing up

You should all be added as collaborators on our GitHub repository already.
If not, make sure you give one of the instructors your GitHub username,
and they can add you to the project.

###   Finding the project

The project repository is 
[https://github.com/OxfordRSE/oxrse_unit_conv](https://github.com/OxfordRSE/oxrse_unit_conv).
It has its visibility set to `public`, so you can see it even if you aren't
signed in. Users who are not collaborators on the project can also contribute,
but they have to do so using the more longwinded approach of forking rather
than cloning.

###   Contribute!

This is where you put into practice what we covered in the walkthrough:

- Create an *issue*
- Clone the repository
- Familiarise yourself with how it works
- Make sure it works on your computer
- Create a *branch*
- Make and *commit* your changes
- *Push* your branch
- Submit a *pull request*
{: .checklist}

###   Review

Each of you has been assigned a partner who will review your changes. The
instructors will also help with the reviews. Let your partner know when you
are ready for them to review your code.

When your partner's code is ready, navigate to their pull request and look
through the changes. Note down any comments you have in the boxes provided.

When your partner has finished reviewing your code, take a look at the
comments they've left. If you find any of them difficult to understand,
discuss what they meant. When you've worked out what, if anything, you should
do to address the comments, make those changes to your code and *commit* and
*push* again. You will see the *pull request* automatically updates when you
push to that branch.

When your code is finished and passes review, we will *merge* it into the
`main` branch. If you *checkout* the `main` branch and *pull* changes, you will
see that your changes are now included.
