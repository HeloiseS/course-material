This course will show you how to use Git for effective collaboration with others
using the GitHub platform. After completion of the course, you will be able to
contribute to projects on GitHub, including opening issues and pull requests.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to save every change made to a
(software) project, allowing others to collaborate and contribute. In this course,
we use Git to version control our code in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code backup and sharing.
GitHub is one of the leading integrated products and
social platforms for modern software development, monitoring and management - it will help us with
version control, issue management, code review, code testing/Continuous Integration, and collaborative development.
