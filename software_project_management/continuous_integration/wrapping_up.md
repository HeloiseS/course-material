## Wrapping up

Continuous integration is an essential tool to improve software quality and reliability.
It drastically increases the chances of catching problems at an early stage, preventing significant effort correcting problems later once they have become entrenched.
On top of that, there are many free services that you can take advantage of for your open source projects.

I would encourage you to look at some examples of repositories using sophisticated continuous integration in production, to see what it can look like for large projects.
I would suggest looking at [PINTS](https://github.com/pints-team/pints).
If you look at any of the open pull requests, you can see each commit pushed to GitHub has a tick or a cross, telling code reviewers at a glance whether all the checks passed.

Getting a good CI pipeline set up early in a project will pay back your time investment many times over.
